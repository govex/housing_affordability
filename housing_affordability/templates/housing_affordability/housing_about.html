                  Why Housing Affordability?
              </div>
              <div style="padding:2%; font-size: 11pt;">
                  Over the previous many months, media stories and surveys have reported that the U.S. is experiencing a housing affordability crisis, while more and more Americans are having difficulty finding affordable homes. Housing experts point to shortages, increased mortgage rates and land costs as some of the reasons.<br>
                  
                  A team of analysts at the Center for Government Excellence (GovEx) re-envisioned the traditional scope of a housing affordability index’s accuracy and purpose. In their initial explorations, the team took note of how other indices presented data and made certain assumptions, as well as the exclusion of some relevant information.<br>
                  
                  How was housing affordability being defined? What research questions are left unasked? Why were some variables being used instead of others in answering the research questions? In an attempt to address these questions and others, the GovEx team began to conduct their research on how affordability has been historically defined and measured.

                  GovEx presents this housing overview and affordability index as both a resource and a call-to-action. While we anticipate the information presented is accessible and informative for city residents, we are also hopeful that local government agencies and other organizations are able to utilize this index to inform programmatic decisions that improve the affordability and life quality of its residents.<br>
                  
                  In its final form, the index defines, measures, and visualizes housing affordability as holistically as possible.<br>
